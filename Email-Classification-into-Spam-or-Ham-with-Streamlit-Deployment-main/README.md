## 📨 Email Spam Classification using NLP & SVM

A machine learning project that classifies email or SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.
Deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time message classification.

---

###  Project Overview

This project leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** for text feature extraction and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classification.
It also includes NLP-based preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization) to clean text data and improve accuracy.

---

###  Features

✅ Classifies any text message as **Spam** or **Ham**
✅ Uses **TF-IDF** and **SVM (linear/RBF kernels)** for robust classification
✅ Implements **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning
✅ Provides **confidence score (%)** for predictions in Streamlit
✅ Visualizes results with a **Confusion Matrix**
✅ Simple, clean, and deployable interface

###  Setup Instructions

#### 1️. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Email-Spam-Classifier.git
cd Email-Spam-Classifier
```

#### 2️. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3️. Train the Model

Ensure your dataset file (`SMSSpamCollection`) is in the correct path, or update it in `train.py`.

Then run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will generate:

* `spam_classifier_model.pkl`
* `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`

#### 4️. Launch Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at:
👉 **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**

###  Example Output

**Input:**

> “Congratulations! You’ve won a $1000 gift card. Claim now!”

**Output:**
 Prediction: **Spam** (98.45% confidence)

### 📊 Model Performance

| Metric    | Score                    |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| Accuracy  | ~95%                     |
| Precision | High for both Spam & Ham |
| Recall    | Balanced across classes  |

A Confusion Matrix heatmap is displayed after training to visualize performance.

###  Preprocessing Steps

1. Lowercasing text
2. Removing punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters
3. Removing English stopwords
4. Lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer
5. TF-IDF Vectorization with `max_features=5000`

---

###  Deployment

###  Dataset Used

Dataset: **[SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)**
Contains 5,574 labeled messages — “ham” (legitimate) or “spam” (unwanted).

---

###  Results

* Optimized SVM using **GridSearchCV** (`C`, `kernel`, `gamma`)
* Achieved **~95% accuracy**
* Demonstrated stable performance on unseen messages
* Clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time testing

---

###  Future Improvements

* Add multilingual spam detection
* Train on real email datasets
* Integrate Gmail API for live email classification
* Compare with deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
